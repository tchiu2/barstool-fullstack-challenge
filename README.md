### Instructions to run
#### Note: this application connects to a local MongoDB instance, so you must have MongoDB installed to use it.

1. Run ```npm install``` in the root project directory.
2. Start your local MongoDB instance on the default port (27017)
3. Run ```npm run dev``` to start both the Node server and React app.

Once the server is running, you can access the React app at ```http://localhost:3000```.
